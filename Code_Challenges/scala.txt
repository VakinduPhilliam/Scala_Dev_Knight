The common wisdom is that one must abandon static typing to eliminate the boilerplate, and there is a rising interest in dynamic languages such as Python, Ruby, and Groovy. 
This common wisdom is debunked by the existence of Martinâ€™s latest brainchild, Scala.
Scala is a tastefully typed language: it is statically typed, but explicit types appear in just the right places. 
Scala takes powerful features from object-oriented and functional languages, and combines them with a few novel ideas in a beautifully coherent whole. 
The syntax is so lightweight, and its primitives so expressive, that APIs can be used with virtually no syntactic overhead at all. 
Examples can be found in standard libraries such as parser combinators and actors. 
In this sense Scala supports embedded domain-specific languages.
